AI-Powered SOC Analyzer
An intelligent Security Operations Center (SOC) tool that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze security logs, detect anomalies, and prioritize cybersecurity threats in real-time. This project aims to automate threat detection and help SOC teams respond faster and more effectively to incidents.

YOU MUST EDIT THE CODE AND INPUT YOUR OWN API KEY

Features
Automated Log Analysis: Ingest and parse logs from multiple sources (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS, servers).

Anomaly Detection: Uses AI models to identify unusual behavior or suspicious activity.

Threat Prioritization: Ranks alerts based on severity and potential impact.

Real-time Alerts: Sends notifications for critical incidents.

Reporting: Generates reports (optional).

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Required libraries (OpenAi, pandas)

Installation:
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/toomanytonys/ai-soc-bot-outline.git
cd ai-soc-bot-outline
Install dependencies:


pip install -r openai pandas


Usage

Open code editor of your choice either:

Option A: Directly in code (quick and dirty)
Edit this line in your Python file:

openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"


Option B: Use a .env file (recommended for security)
Create a file named .env:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Install dotenv:

pip install python-dotenv
In your script:


from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Run the main analyzer script:

bash
python ai_soc_bot.py
